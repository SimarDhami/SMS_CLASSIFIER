Spam SMS Classifier ðŸ“±ðŸš«

Spam SMS Classifier is a machine learning-based project designed to detect and filter out spam messages from legitimate ones. By analyzing the content of SMS messages, the classifier accurately labels them as "spam" or "ham" (not spam), helping users avoid unwanted and malicious texts. This tool is ideal for enhancing SMS filtering systems and improving message security.

Key Features
Accurate Classification: Detects and categorizes messages as spam or non-spam with high precision.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Utilizes techniques like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and more for effective classification.
Text Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses SMS data to enhance classification accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy to integrate into existing systems or use as a standalone tool.

How It Works
Data Preprocessing: SMS messages are cleaned, tokenized, and transformed into features.
Training the Model: A machine learning model is trained on labeled data to recognize patterns in spam messages.
Classifying New Messages: The model classifies incoming SMS messages as spam or non-spam.

Technologies Used
Python: Core language for building the classifier.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for training and evaluating models.
NLP Techniques: For text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).
Pandas & Numpy: For data handling and manipulation.

Future Enhancements
Implementing deep learning models for improved accuracy.
Real-time classification for integration with messaging systems.
Adding support for multiple languages.
